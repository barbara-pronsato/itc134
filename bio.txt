Barbara Pronsato Biography

I love coding. 

That wasn't always the case...I once hated coding...but in the very beginning there was a little girl nambe Barbara, in Argentina, it was the 70s and her dad decided to 
set out for the United States to find a place for his family. 

A few months later the rest of the family joined him in Virginia, Alexandria. A year after that they decided to move again to Southern California, Orange County. 

It was the 80s it was sunny, it was kind of boring except for the malls and the beaches. Barbara graduated from University High School and then her family moved to Florida. 

She stayed behind, after a year alone in California she decided to visit her family in Florida and for some weird reason (she met a guy) decided to stay. 

Then after a couple of years of suffocating heat and humidity she moved back to Southern California with said guy. 

Then a bunch of stuff happened....

Fast forward to more or less today...Barbara lost her job from a company that went caput...when she realized that most jobs she was applying for required a degree, she

got the great idea to get one....
